# Group4_Project_2019
IB Group 4 project for the POHS computer science class of 2019

Project Description:

  Our Group 4 project was to link an LED board to a school twitter account to relay announcements to the student body. For this project, we used various libraries to aid us in developing our code as well as relying on code examples from projects similar to ours. This project required us to work together to pull tweets from the internet, program and wire the LED board, as well as build a containment unit.
